# WordPress.org SVN deploy script for easily publishing your WordPress plugins that primarily use the Git version control system.
#
# Deploy script came from here: https://github.com/thenbrent/multisite-user-management/blob/master/deploy.sh
# Which is a modification of Dean Clatworthy's deploy script as found here: https://github.com/deanc/wordpress-plugin-git-svn
# The difference is that this script lives in the plugin's git repo & doesn't require an existing SVN repo.

# This script needs to be executable (chmod +x wporg-deploy.sh)

# main config
PLUGINSLUG="Resize-images-before-upload"
CURRENTDIR=`pwd`
MAINFILE="resize-images-before-upload.php" # this should be the name of your main php file in the wordpress plugin

# git config

# svn config
