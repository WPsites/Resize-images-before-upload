Resize your images before they are uploaded to your website (server), no need to use image editing software. You can drag+drop images straight from your digital camera right into WordPress.

== Description ==

Plupload, the upload handler that is now utilised in WordPress has resize capabilities built in (as well as drag and drop). At this stage this functionality is not fully utilised in core, although I'm sure it will be included eventually. 

This plugin removes the upload file size limit and turns on the resize function.

Once this plugin is enabled you will see a new option on the media upload screen to resize your images before upload. Once clicked, any images you try to upload will be resized within your browser before uploading to the server.

* Less bandwidth used for your host when uploading your images
* No more massive images uploaded to your site for users to sit waiting to view/download
* You can drag images right off your digital camera onto the WordPress uploader, getting them online in a flash.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work on all browsers? =

 I don't think so. This looks like part of the reason this function is left out of WordPress core. Might be a good idea for users to add any browser resizing issues to the support forum so we know where the issues are. It works on Chrome and Firefox, that I do know!
